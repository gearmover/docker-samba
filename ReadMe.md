# Intro
A Dockerfile for a self-contained Samba volume. Use it like this

`bash
docker build -t gearmover/samba .
`

`bash
docker run -d -v somedirectory:/data gearmover/samba
`

And you'll see a printout of the URL you can access the samba share from locally.  I'm not sure of the ports to expose, but if you
expose the necessary ports it'll work remotely as well.  Enjoy!
